# Rods-01-Challenge-MKTG
Marketing agency site optimized for search engines.

## Description

This challenge is to test if I can pull, commit and push an existing code from a marketing agency website – along with the site assets, such as images – to a GitHub repository, so that I finally demonstrate that I can deploy a website.
It was also a first taste of how to clean-up a code, to facilitate further improvements.

## Installation

You'll just have to access the website from the URL, no installation required.

## Usage

Scroll along and read more about the agency.
## Credits

The code was built by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., I'm just deploying it so that it can be accessed remotly from any browser.
## License

The licence specifications can be found in the repository.
