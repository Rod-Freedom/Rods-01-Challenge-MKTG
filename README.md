# Rods-01-Challenge-MKTG
Marketing agency site optimized for search engines.

## Description
This challenge is to test if I can pull, commit and push an existing code from a marketing agency website – along with the site assets, such as images – to a GitHub repository, so that I finally demonstrate that I can deploy a website.
It was also a first taste of how to clean-up a code, to facilitate further improvements.

## Installation
You'll just have to access the website [here](https://rod-freedom.github.io/Rods-01-Challenge-MKTG/), no installation required.

## Usage
Scroll along and read more about the agency. The links at the header will take you to your topic of interest.

This is how it should look like:

## Credits

## License
The licence specifications can be found in the repository.
